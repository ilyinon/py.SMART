0.31 - 2017/02/09
[BUG FIXES]
    * Converted Popen.communicate() method's 'bytes' output to string
[ENHANCEMENTS]
    * Added Maxim Korobko's megaraid work
    * Fixed code for following PEP8

0.3 - 2015/06/10
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[BUG FIXES]
    * Now able to parse used endurance indicator (ie: SSD life left) from HGST
      and Seagate SAS SSDs.
    * Fixed crash when attempting to parse self-test entries from HGST and
      Seagate SAS devices with an empty self-test log.
[ENHANCEMENTS]
    * Generally improved detection of empty self-test logs prior to attempting
      to parse self-test entries.
[ADMINISTRATIVE]
    * Added support for FreeBSD with smartctl 6.1+ to the version check in
      utils.py by request. No testing has been performed with FreeBSD, this
      only prevents the code from aborting due to the unknown OS string.

0.2 - 2015/01/06
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[BUG FIXES]
    * Now properly detects whether a SMART self-test was initiated when
      requested on SAS/SCSI devices.
    * Now properly detects when a SMART self-test has completed on
      SAS/SCSI devices.
    * The values of diagnostic attributes 'Load_Cycle_Pct_Left' and
      'Start_Stop_Pct_Left' are now set to '-' if the manufacturer's
      specification is '0' (unlimited - typical of SSDs).
    * Diagnostic attribute 'Load_Cycle_Pct_Left' now obtains the intended
      default value '-' when not supported by a device.
[ENHANCEMENTS]
    * Disambiguation of SAS from SCSI is more robust for older devices which
      do not support the SAS PHY log command.
    * Extraction of power-on time from SAS/SCSI devices is more robust.
    * The calculated values of diagnostic attributes 'Load_Cycle_Pct_Left' and
      'Start_Stop_Pct_Left' now include the '%' sign.
[ADMINISTRATIVE]
    * Corrected the package manifest to include the GPLv2 license file.
